<h4>Easy tips on how to improve web accessibility for web editors and content managers</h4>

<p>I created this presentation for the <a href="http://letstalkscience.ca">Let's Talk Science</a> June Staff Plenary. Most of the issues and solutions were examples
gleaned from auditing for and resolving web accessibility issues with numerous LTS web assets. Despite the fact that these examples were taken from a specific project, the issues and solutions are widely applicable.</p>
